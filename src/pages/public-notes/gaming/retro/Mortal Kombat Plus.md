Klassic Mortal Kombat Updated
Midway released three classic arcade fighting games known as Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
We spent months disassembling the original Midway code and fixed known issues that were never fixed by Midway without harming the original gameplay. We also added some new exciting features as well as some new exciting secrets to be found.
The result is the classic Mortal Kombat games we know and love made by the original Midway team in the nineties simply… updated.
