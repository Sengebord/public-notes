# [Using an Amiga in 2021: Making an intro](https://datagubbe.se/mkdem/) ([datagubbe.se](from?site=datagubbe.se)) |

> This was a fantastic walk-through of the making of intro, including great descriptions of some Amiga tech and features, plus: quite the cute little intro!Reminded me a lot of some of the quick-shot productions me and my friends used to do back then! It was very satisfying to do these little single-screen things, sometimes in a single day/night, that were perhaps (eh) less about showing off massive technical chops (never my forte, especially not back as a teenager) and more about mood, sometimes humor, or simply just ... saying something. Then when the thing was done, you got to start spreading it by (of course) using your modem and uploading it to some choice bulletin board systems.Amazing that Datagubbe (which by the way is translated by the author [1] as "old computer fogey" although I feel the Swedish word "gubbe" is really hard to translate well) wrote this in AMOS by the way, I used that a lot but mostly for tooling and general playing around, never for any released productions, they were always in assembly.[1]: https://datagubbe.se/colophon/

> > Yeah, I remember a lot of AMOS-hostility from Amiga developers back then. Did someone actually write demos/intros in it back then or would the collective wrath of the assembly programmers be too much? ;)(Along with AMOS, MUI was often a target. Quaint these days, given our current UI behemoths.)

> > > As the original author wrote, assembler is top level leet-ness. However, we aren't in our teenager years anymore and cannot spend holidays hacking our Amigas, so time constraint is a thing. To be honest, assembler coding was always tedious to say the least. Debugging, Gurus, just to name a few in inconveniences.This opened a chance for Amos.If you have a look at today's leet-ness, have a look a The Black Lotus. They do everything with a cross-development pipeline, they even forked Amiga UAE to streamline their process. TBL is really top notch Amiga coding, fantastic stuff.Amos and cross-development compile to machine code in the end. Besides that it is about easing things.For reference, here is Abyss' fantastic project: https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug

> > > > Amos is very well known for having one of the best developer documentation that exists for the amiga machine. It's not a poor choice. Amos is still being developed by Francois Lionet. https://www.aoz.studio/the-aoz-story

> > > > > I did not say that. I like Amos nowadays. However, it wasn't a serious choice for any of us working on demos or tools back then, even usage of Amiga C was uncommon.Same goes for Basic on C64. It is not that I dislike Basic. It simply the fact, that you get different results using assembler on C64.

> > > > Cross-development probably makes the most sense these days. Given that Rust and LLVM can already cross-compile for 68k, I wonder if anyone is planning to leverage the Rust embedded ecosystem to ease bare-metal development for these old machines (Amiga, Atari ST, 68k Mac etc.)

> > > Well, back in the day, when intros still fulfilled their original purpose of being added to cracked games, every byte that you could save counted. Most games already used the 880K available on an Amiga floppy pretty well, so the chances of finding an extra 64K for your intro were slim...

> > > Indeed it terms of view/emotions from "real programmers" towards AMOS - it was like Visual Basic <= v6.And in practice I recall it was also slow for doing things like bigger scrolling things - like isometric RTS map, SimCity ...etc

> If you want to go a bit more hardcore (no AMOS-shaming btw), there's also an excellent Amiga VSCode extension written by Bartman/Abyss. [0] It has full debugging, profiling, etc. It's quite insane.And it's probably a good time to also plug my 6502 assembler again, which has really decent VSCode support as well.

> > 6502 assembler, good times with some SID tunes (or armsid) in the background :)

> Demoscene is such an interesting form of art. If you are interested, watch this documentary: https://youtu.be/iRkZcTg1JWU The 4k (not the resolution) are very impressive.

> https://youtu.be/8Xq0fgfXgq8

> Hoped for a star scroller and a starfield :-) I was very proud when I wrote them in my first Amiga intro. Because unknown demo groups are named, we went with Traveller (nearly joined RSI! ;-) after we went with The Yolk Rogues for some time.

> I still follow the Scene by watching winning demos from various parties/competitions. One minor comment if I may, I think the biggest demoparty and the best one IMHO, is Assembly ;-)

> Nostalgia hit me hard reading/watching that.

> I submitted this 11 hours ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33195162

> > Yeah, happens to all of us, don't feel bad :-)Some submissions get unnoticed and some others with the exact same link gain traction and start having comments and being upvoted.I'm sure if @Dang had spare time there would be a filter, during submission of a new link, to check whether the exact same link already exists.

> > > > I'm sure if @Dang had spare time there would be a filter, during submission of a new link, to check whether the exact same link already exists.There is. Duplicate submissions get redirected to the existing thread. Sometimes it doesn't kick in, for reasons obscure.

> Very useful, I might try building a remake of "Cow Postman" during the weekend.

> The demoscene is just the purest, coolest shit ever. Makes me wish I had grown up in Finland!

> > I grew up in Finland during the 1990s and was pretty active in the demoscene.It was a really great creative hobby, but it doesn’t deserve to be viewed entirely through rose-tinted nostalgia. There were a lot of awesome people, but also toxic assholes and mean-spirited bullies. I suppose that’s par for the course for any community with so many teenagers.

> > > I agree. Mobbing and public shaming was definitely a thing, just have a look at all the "XYZ is a lamer", Federations against XYZ, anti demos, and stuff that was published using disk magazines, and sometimes declaration of war against other groups."Happy" times. ;)

> > > > I always took that as harmless posturing, given that the 'XYZ' was invariably a pseudonym. Modern FLOSS development needs codes of conflict that forbid this behavior because we fully involve our personal and professional identities in it.

> > > > > Not at all. During the 80th and early 90th I encountered many personal attacks, and few of them escalated into physical encounters. I was involved quite heavily into the C64 and Amiga scene, attended quite a few copy parties.Most conflicts I knew of, started on a personal level. 98% of the persons that attacked each other knew each other in real life. The scene met at copy parties, or did phone conferences.There were also some funny encounters, when groups who were at war with each other met at copy parties.In Venlo for example, I remember the bouncer quite well, because he was some huge 2.10m dude.I can tell you of dozens of other encounters. Some works, that caused trouble, are even sanctioned by officials. And this is good.

> > Denmark was also a very nice place to grow up back then :)
> > We had (have) a lot of legends of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.

> > > The Party in Aars… oh the memories…

> > We were also a part of it in Portugal, that is how I got to play with Amigas, without having one at home.

> > I wish too! Still, managed to find the local scene here in Portugal, some of it still active. We’re having a party in a couple of weeks.

> > I wasn't really part of it, but it felt pretty happening in England too :)

> I loved making intros and demos on my C64. I never had Amiga :(

> Every time I have attempted to emulate an Amiga I've found it such a painful experience. Do others find the same?

> > Yes, I have completely given up actually.

> > About 10 years ago I've been replaying bunch of Amiga titles from my childhood on a phone (Nokia N900) in UAE and it worked wonderfully well.

> > Nah, I found WinUAE to be excellent and problem-free.
