> When prospective customers can't taste, test, feel, smell,
> or watch the product in operation in advance, what they are
> asked to buy are, simply, promises of satisfaction. Even tangi-

> bought, largely promises.
> Satisfaction later in consumption or use can seldom be quite
> the same as earlier in trial or promise. Some promises promise
> more than others. It depends on product features, design, degree
> of tangibility, type of promotion, price, and differences in what
> customers hope to accomplish with what they buy. Of some
> products less is expected than what is explicitly or symbolically
> promised. The right kind of eye shadow properly applied may
> promise to transform you into an irresistible tigress in the night.
> But not even the most eager buyer literally believes the meta-
> phor. Still, the metaphor makes the sale. Neither do you literally
